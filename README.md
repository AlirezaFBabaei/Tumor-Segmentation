# Tumor-Segmentation
This project is dedicated to simplifying brain tumor segmentation tasks through a modified U-Net architecture, enhanced with the integration of batch normalization. We've engineered our solution to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring it can run smoothly even on modest computing setups, thereby expanding accessibility to a broader user base.

Brain tumor segmentation poses inherent challenges, primarily due to the small size of tumors relative to the surrounding brain tissue. Our approach tackles this challenge by employing strategies to effectively handle the imbalanced data distribution. The integration of batch normalization further enhances the stability and convergence of the segmentation model, contributing to more accurate delineation of tumor regions.

Central to our solution is the modification of the U-Net architecture, a widely adopted framework for medical image segmentation tasks. We've streamlined and optimized the architecture to prioritize efficiency without compromising performance, making it suitable for deployment across various computing environments.

Our overarching goal is to democratize access to advanced medical image analysis techniques. Whether you're a seasoned researcher, a healthcare professional, or a developer working on medical imaging applications, our system offers a user-friendly and accessible solution for addressing the critical task of brain tumor segmentation.
